				Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players on a cricket field, 
				at the centre of which is a rectangular 22-yard-long pitch with a wicket (a set of three wooden stumps) 
				sited at each end. One team, designated the batting team, attempts to score as many runs as possible, 
				whilst their opponents field. Each phase of play is called an innings. After either ten batsmen have been 
				dismissed or a fixed number of overs have been completed, the innings ends and the two teams then swap roles. 
				The winning team is the one that scores the most runs, including any extras gained, during their one or two innings.

				HTML5 is the next major revision of the HTML standard superseding HTML 4.01, XHTML 1.0, and XHTML 1.1. 
				HTML5 is a standard for structuring and presenting content on the World Wide Web.
				HTML5 is a cooperation between the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and the Web Hypertext Application Technology 
				Working Group (WHATWG).The new standard incorporates features like video playback and drag-and-drop that have 
				been previously dependent on third-party browser plug-ins such as Adobe Flash, Microsoft Silverlight, and Google Gears.

				The latest versions of Apple Safari, Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Opera all support many HTML5 features and 
				Internet Explorer 9.0 will also have support for some HTML5 functionality.The mobile web browsers that come 
				pre-installed on iPhones, iPads, and Android phones all have excellent support for HTML5.

				HTML5 is designed, as much as possible, to be backward compatible with existing web browsers. 
				New features build on existing features and allow you to provide fallback content for older browsers.
				It is suggested to detect support for individual HTML5 features using a few lines of JavaScript.
				If you are not familiar with any previous version of HTML, I would recommend to go through our HTML 
				Tutorial before you explore further concepts of HTM5.

				The HTML 5 language has a "custom" HTML syntax that is compatible with HTML 4 and XHTML1 documents published on the Web, 
				but is not compatible with the more esoteric SGML features of HTML 4.
				HTML 5 does not have the same syntax rules as XHTML where we needed lower case tag names, quoting our attributes,an attribute
				had to have a value and to close all empty elements.
